# Quiz

Pij Coursework 5

This project is an rmi server/client based quiz.

There is one server and two clients.
The two clients are:
A setupClient - used to create and edit quizes.
A playerClient - used to play quizes.

To use this quiz you need to first launch the server 
(located in the serverAndClientLaunchers).You can 
then launch one or both of the clients (they are 
independent). The server.policy file is required
for launching.

Note: The quiz system is working but as of today 
there is little testing, due to my running short of
time and wanting to have a working system to submit.
